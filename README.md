# Predict-user-emotions-based-on-social-media-usage
  This project uses a user's social media usage to determine their emotions, based on machine learning algorithms.
  Knowing a user's emotions is incredibly useful! Based on their emotions, we can do targeted marketing, and we can determine a user's level of psychological well-being based on their emotions. The essence of business is not selling products, just like Apple does not sell phones, but sells a sense of luxury. Coca-Cola does not sell soda, but happiness. And Xiaomi does not sell phones, but touches people's hearts. 
  Below, I will compare the pre-processing effects of several different machine learning algorithms using Jupyter notebook.
  The dataset (Social Media Usage and Emotional Well-Being) originates from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/social-media-usage-and-emotional-well-being/data
